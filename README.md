# EV Adoption and CO₂ Emissions Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between electric vehicle (EV) adoption and reductions in CO₂ emissions in the Americas. By analyzing historical data from 2010 to 2023, it identifies trends and correlations, providing insights into how EVs contribute to environmental goals.

## Objectives
- Evaluate whether EV adoption correlates with reductions in CO₂ emissions.
- Highlight regional variations and key trends.
- Inform future policy and investment decisions.

## Data Sources
1. **EV Adoption Data**: Annual EV sales and cumulative stock data from the International Energy Agency (IEA).
2. **CO₂ Emissions Data**: Annual per capita emissions from the World Bank Open Data platform.

## Features
- Automated data pipeline for cleaning, transforming, and merging datasets.
- Statistical analysis using Pearson correlation.
- Visualizations to highlight trends and insights.

## Key Findings
- A strong negative correlation (-0.84) between EV sales and CO₂ emissions.
- Significant emissions reductions in regions with robust EV policies.
- Year-over-year analysis shows variability in EV sales growth aligning with gradual emissions reductions.
