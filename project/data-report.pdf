# Data Report

## Question
This project investigates the relationship between electric vehicle (EV) adoption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the Americas. The main question is: *Does the increase in EV adoption contribute to a measurable reduction in GHG emissions, indicating a positive impact on climate change?*

## Data Sources

### 1. Electric Vehicle Data
- **Source**: International Energy Agency (IEA)
- **Dataset URL**: [Global EV Data Explorer](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/global-ev-data-explorer)
- **Content**: Historical EV sales, stocks, and infrastructure data.
- **License**: The dataset is under the IEA's open-data policy for non-commercial use. Obligations are met by crediting the source and linking to their license page.

### 2. Emissions Data
- **Source**: World Bank Open Data
- **Dataset URL**: [CO₂ Emissions](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators)
- **Content**: Annual CO₂ emissions per capita by country.
- **License**: Open access under World Bank’s terms for public use. Obligations are met by providing source attribution.

## Data Structure and Quality
- **Electric Vehicle Data**: Tabular CSV, consistent format, includes year, region, and sales data. Clean and complete.
- **Emissions Data**: Tabular CSV, includes year, region, and CO₂ levels. Requires handling of missing data and outliers.

## Data Pipeline

### Overview
- **Technology**: Python, Pandas, SQLite.
- **Input Format**: CSV files from public repositories.
- **Output Format**: SQLite database for structured and efficient analysis.

### Steps in the Pipeline
1. **Data Download**: Automated retrieval of datasets from hosted locations.
2. **Cleaning and Transformation**:
   - Renamed columns for uniformity.
   - Imputed missing values using forward-fill.
   - Skipped invalid rows using `on_bad_lines='skip'`.
3. **Storage**: Datasets stored in SQLite for querying and integration.

### Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge**: Inconsistent data rows in CSV files.
  - **Solution**: Used `on_bad_lines='skip'` and manual inspection.
- **Challenge**: Handling missing data.
  - **Solution**: Imputed missing values with forward-fill (`ffill()`).
- **Meta-Quality Measures**:
  - Skips invalid rows.
  - Logs errors during execution.

## Results and Limitations

### Output Data
- **Electric Vehicle Data**: Cleaned and structured EV sales and stock data.
- **Emissions Data**: Yearly CO₂ emissions data, processed for consistency.

### Quality of Output
- **Structure**: Tabular SQLite database with two tables (`ev_data` and `emissions_data`).
- **Issues**: Potential bias in emissions data, as not all countries report consistently.

### Limitations
- **Representativeness**: Some countries lack comprehensive data.
- **Timeliness**: Historical data may not reflect current trends.
